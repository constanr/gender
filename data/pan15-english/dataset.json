I'd assume that designers would understand/appreciate usability.\t\t\n@username Will this work with the regular PC forum accounts or do we have to make new ones? Would be handy to have that integrated.\t\t\n@username Gotta be honest here, these sprites feel kind of blurry and lacking detail. A downside of 3d, or maybe a render/filter issue?\t\t\n@username Can hardly wait for PC version X. What I've gathered there are a bunch of small visual tweaks and a lot of under-the-hood work.\t\t\n@username Yeah I know they're 2x. I scaled the image down to 50% first to check my gut. Does ingame have normals or something?\t\t\n@username I just finished my last game for the day, this should be a nice way to unwind.\t\t\n@username @username It really depends on the quality of the stuff, much like chocolate.

You will be surgeried by only the most pro of fessionals. http://t.co/c8qaZNjW3L\t\t\n@username How are the podcasts rubbish? Only thing edited for (the YT version of) that are the commercials, right?\t\t\n@username I get the removal of streamed 'regular' music, I do. But background music from games? And beyond that, do you think that (1/2)\t\t\n@username it should apply to games in general? (textures+models+etc=\u00a9, too) You generally say that streaming is a transformative art.\t\t\n@username Technically, this is a mobile game. And I'm not sure I would call this 'playing'.\t\t\nYup, salticidae are definitely the bestest, coolest and most awesomest spiders.\n\nhttps://t.co/Wr1elzCRf4\t\t\n@username No. You'd be wasting far too much time debugging variables, when such a simple command is all you need.\t\t\n@username Ooh. Sanchez. I strongly approve of this.\t\t\n@username @username @username I'm in that camp. Everyone* has a smartphone now, which makes it a true -personal- computer.\t\t\n@username @username The biggest problem with round robin is a lack of focus. Sports thrive on spectators. (semi)Finals get more views.\t\t\n@username @username Says it right there \"? The Jester Race\nA song by In Flames\"\t\t\n@username @username Given that you regularly do long takes, though, this one felt \"slighly off\". (j/k well done Zooc)\t\t\n@username Lamb allergy is a pretty lame allergy.\t\t\n@username I think you're mixing up Gone Home and Dear Esther. Not many people argued Gone Home wasn't a game, just not a GOOD one.\t\t\n@username I think you should do a combination. Good projects deserve love, but also one/sporadic supercut of bad to keep people warned.\t\t\n@username It might work to have a few bad trailers at the start of each vid? Nope, nope, nope, this looks decent.\t\t\n@username @username @username Hurrah! You didn't call it the A/S/L challenge. +1 for knowing the actual charity's name.\t\t\n@username @username Heck, look at people lighting up torches and pitchforks after spending just a few hundred dollars on a gaming box...\t\t\n@username AND DOLLA DOLLA BILLS YO. (also my shirt)\t\t\n@username @username http://t.co/LrtfFdiNqJ seems kind of relevant in this case too. From several perspectives.\t\t\n@username You're right on the first account. Many would argue about the 2nd; the nature of  debates is divisive. http://t.co/E4kkt588dH\t\t\n@username What's the crest for that?\t\t\n@username That actually seems interesting data, yeah. I wonder if there's some kind of metrics script for that.\t\t\nUsing your phone can be dangerous even if you're not driving. Sorry mr snail...\t\t\n@username Liking youtubers isn't a problem either. Which leaves \"harassing\" as the only issue.\t\t\n@username Threat? Or... treat?\t\t\nSimple yet clear marking of gluten/lactose/vegetarian/etc foods. Good on you, Germany. http://t.co/W62Wy4yIyr\t\t\n@username I know, right. You're actually complain about framerates and texture quality most of the time.\t\t\n@username For me, personally, it's like a TV show. I can relax to it because it's more passive than articles, yet is not supershort.\t\t\n@username @username Quite an innovative new 'exclusive' system; just exclude yourself from a lot of games.Wonder where this will go?\t\t\n@username @username You mean \"asshole\" culture, within the gaming and internet audience, right? I'm pretty sure that's what you mean.\t\t\n@username @username @username Should the flooding work that way? Don't you need 2 holes; one for water in, one for air out?\t\t\n@username Dual monocles and tophat for maximum gentlemanliness.\t\t\n@username Jim, try Monster Rehab. It's not nearly as sugary as regular (about 25%) but it doesn't taste like deat-... I mean sweeteners.\t\t\n@username @username Unless your licence gets voided, in which case you pay \u20ac35 AND \u20ac70. Personally, I just wait for price drops.\t\t\n@username @username And what if it gets voided before you managed to install/play?\t\t\n@username @username It was a hypothetical. Hence why he says \"at your own risk\". It might work fine, it might cost you.\t\t\n@username Definitely think that you do 3 can stop early. A game has max 20 minutes, if it impresses you sooner, good on it.\t\t\n@username @username Ooh, this is pretty. Any info on how it's done? Looks like uprezzed render, sure, but any special texture approach?\t\t\n@username What, you're able to not hate someone you disagree with? Is this some kind of magic? Are you a wizerds?\t\t\n@username @username It is rather uncanny... http://t.co/EzJMUWrtS0\t\t\nJust binge-read the entirety of @username's comic. It's gooood. http://t.co/jVOCCOc5fp\t\t\n@username @username With 300+ employees, they're well past the 'Dunbar number'; a group of ~150 is what our human brains can manage.\t\t\nDidn't know I, a European, could send emails about net neutrality to US Gov. EUROPEANS UNITE! http://t.co/iJssKlF3rJ http://t.co/11MWt6BLo7\t\t\n@username I've always likened Dear Esther to a book or movie. You can press play/pause, but you don't really have any agency.\t\t\n@username Personally, I'd love physical media as an option, if it were JUST that. But most games nowadays are just a DVD + steam code.\t\t\n@username Next bundle? http://t.co/OJ7iOFedwb\t\t\n@username you have your own NPC and you're giving out games?

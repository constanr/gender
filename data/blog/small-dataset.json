[{"text": " Guest Demo: Eric Iverson\u2019s Itty Bitty Search\nFebruary 16th, 2010 by Daniel Tunkelang\nRespond\n\nI\u2019m back from vacation, and still digging my way out of everything that\u2019s piled up while I\u2019ve been offline.\n\nWhile I catch up, I thought I\u2019d share with you a demo that Eric Iverson was gracious enough to share with me. It uses Yahoo! BOSS to support an exploratory search experience on top of a general web search engine.\n\nWhen you perform a query, the application retrieves a set of related term candidates using Yahoo\u2019s key terms API. It then scores each term by dividing its occurrence count within the result set by its global occurrence count\u2013a relevance measure similar to one my former colleagues and I used at Endeca in enterprise contexts.\n\nYou can try out the demo yourself at http://www.ittybittysearch.com/. While it has rough edges, it produces nice results\u2013especially considering the simplicity of the approach.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how I used the application to explore and learn something new. I started with [\"information retrieval\"]. I noticed \u201cinteractive information retrieval\u201d as a top term, so I used it to refine. Most of the refinement suggestions looked familiar to me\u2013but an unfamiliar name caught my attention: \u201cAnton Leuski\u201d. Following my curiosity, I refined again. Looking at the results, I immediately saw that Leuski had done work on evaluating document clustering for interactive information retrieval. Further exploration made it clear this is someone whose work I should get to know\u2013check out his home page!\n\nI can\u2019t promise that you\u2019ll have as productive an experience as I did, but I encourage you to try Eric\u2019s demo. It\u2019s simple examples like these that remind me of the value of pursuing HCIR for the open web.\n\nSpeaking of which, HCIR 2010 is in the works. We\u2019ll flesh out the details over the next weeks, and of course I\u2019ll share them here.", "gender": "M"}, {"text": "Who moved my Cheese???   The world has been developing in and out in all the areas and to create a difference in this competitive world... we need to change...\nchange the way we take our things...\nbut we rather change or atleast try to change..... we try the same routine work evryday and expect to get more\nand when things fail such as losing a job, loss in business we would upset, discouraged, frustrated and keep on hanging to the same thing again and start complaining.\nCHANGE IS GOOD.... LETS WELCOME IT..!!!\nwondering wat is all about Cheese?? and what actually is all about \" Who Moved My Cheese??? \"\n\n\nWell...!!!! Who moved my cheese?? is a simple parable that reveals profound thoughts. It is an enlightening story of four characters who live in a maze and look for cheese to nourish them and make them happy. The story is about two mice called \"SNIFF\" and \"SCURRY\" and two little men ... smaller in size and who were similar to us people. Their names were \"HEM\" and \"HAW\"\n\nCheese is a metaphor for what you want to have in life - whether it is a good job, loving relationship, money or a possession, health or spiritual peace of mind.\n\nAnd the maze is where you look for what you want - the organisation you work in, or the family or community you live in.\n\nEveryday both the mice and men spent time in the maze looking for their own special cheese. The mice had only Rodent brains while the men used their brains, filled with many beliefs. The common thing between the rodents and these men is tat every morning they went in search for the cheese.\n\nThe maze had confusing network of paths corridors and some of the chambers had delicious cheese. But there were also dark corners and blind alleys leading nowhere. It was an easy place to get lost. Those who found the way to secret chambers had to enjoy a better life.\n\nAfter much of searching they found a chamber C which had an enormous amount of richest quality of Cheese.Rodents used the trial and error method by racing through the corridors. While the men used their brains and beliefs and experience.\n\nHAVING CHEESE MADE THEM HAPPY.\nBoth these men and rodents enjoyed the cheese everyday almost many many days and finally one day was such tat the cheese had to run out and there isnt left anymore.\nRodents observed the minute details of cheese getting decreased day by day and they were ready for the situation and were ready for the hunt of new Cheese.\nOn the otherhand these men based on their beliefs wondered \"Who moved their Cheese?\". Both HEM and HAW kept waiting for the cheese at the old place. Fearing that they might get lost in the maze they didnt start to find their way to new cheese and started starving and waiting in the old place. Both of them kept Hemming and Hawing for their old Cheese. But couldnt find any and increased frustration in them. It also created FEAR in them about what might happend if they get lost in finding new cheese..!!!\nThey started evaluating the situation at Chamber C and waited there everyday and returned homes hungry.\nTHEY WERE AFRAID OF CHANGE.\n\nMeanwhile,Rodents found out their new way and found a chamber N having more cheese than the older one.\n\nEverytime HAW wanted to go in search for the new Cheese. HEM would stop him. But one day in utter despair to find the new Cheese HAW started for his search leaving behind his friend HEM in the old chamber. He wrote on a wall so tat his friend had something to think about...\nIF YOU DONOT CHANGE, YOU CAN BECOME EXTINCT.\nand HAW in order to overcome his fear of getting lost in the maze ... he reminded himself as..\nWHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WEREN'T AFRAID?\nhe continued his search and found a dark alley where he could smell some nice cheese\nhe was afraid of what might be on the other end... and started walking towards it.\nAND when he moved he felt free and rather more young than he is.\n\nWHEN YOU MOVE BEYOND YOUR FEAR, YOU FEEL FREE.!!!\nbut he didnt find any cheese it had some little pieces left over near the chamber, someone had already visited the chamber and completed it. He gulped some cheese leftover and kept some for his friend in his pocket and wondered if HEM was still in chamber C\n\nAll the while throughtout his search he kept on noticing the changes in him.. and everytime he is feeling happy and on the way back to his friend HEM , HAW had been thinking of himself as..\nwhy he hadnt moved out before to find the new cheese...??\nTHE QUICKER YOU LET GO , OF OLD CHEESE THE SOONER YOU FIND NEW CHEESE.\nIT IS SAFER TO SEARCH IN THE MAZE THAN REMAIN IN A CHEESELESS SITUATION.\nOLD BELIEFS DONOT LEAD YOU TO NEW CHEESE.\nHAW came back to his friend HEW and told his experience expecting him to turn out for searching. but HEW didnt.\nso he left him there and returned for his new treasure. before coming he told him about the way he felt and shared the cheese wid him.\nHAW started his journey back to the maze.\n\nWHEN YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN FIND AND ENJOY NEW CHEESE, YOU CHANGE COURSE.\nNOTICING SMALL CHANGES EARLY HELPS YOU ADAPT TO BIGGER CHANGES THAT ARE TO COME.\nfinally haw saw a bigger chamber wid all the variety of cheese wid enormous quantity and was happy to find the rodents der enjoying the cheese. but this time haw was ready for the change observing the minute changes so tat he could act fast.\n\nAs days passed one fine day he heard the footsteps and guessed it was HEW and was happy finally he started searching for the new cheese..!!!\n\n(HAW could have gone to HEW and say about the new cheese at the chamber N. but he didnt since one cannot infuse the seeds to overcome the fear and accept the change . it should be from inself)\n\nso evryone out der.... let us\nANTICIPATE CHANGE\nADAPT TO CHANGE QUICKLY\nENJOY THE CHANGE\nBE READY TO CHANGE QUICKLY,AGAIN AND AGAIN\n\nSo who you are ???

This has been good for Europe and bad for America. In Europe we have an amazing choice of fixed line internet providers for example. In the USA, there is generally one DSL provider and one Cable provider per territory. As a result, we have more bandwidth for less money. This is surprising because, in general, there is more choice at a better price for a lot of goods and services in the USA, including cars, banking and financial services, gadgets, etc. But the problem with the USA is that sometimes lobbying is more influential than the common good. In Europe, our career public servants seem to be less immune to lobbying (although not always, and banking, for example, seems to be an exception and most countries protect their local banks).

I was waiting for a bus and Getting pretty restless, I started twirling my cellphone between my thumb and middle finger. I almost dropped my cellphone in shock as I heard a voice to my right yell, \"o*** dei! Cellphone vechirundha periya m***** nee?\"  Completely nonplussed, I turned around to see a pretty decently dressed chap on a bike looking straight at me with a furious look on his face. I didn't quite get it. The person standing in front of me seemed startled too. Guess he felt the guy was looking at him. That only confused me further. I couldn't quite make out who he was staring at! (Random note to self: Fury adds a squint to ur eye!!)\n  The-guy-in-front-of-me, let's jus call him X for my aching fingers' sake(!), was visibly offended. \"Excuse me?\" he said, his voice quavering lightly. He seemed guarded and didn't turn around to face the Biker dude (gotta make do with this name for the time being!) straight on. But nothing in the world could have prepared me for what followed next. My jaw almost hit the floor in bewilderment when the Biker dude retorted, \"Enna da English-la peela vudarae? English-la pesina nee periya p******-ya?\"  I could feel every eye in the bus stop trained on the three of us. What was happening? Why was he picking up a fight for no reason? And all of a sudden, a silly thought crossed my mind. Silly, but every inch possible. Was this some show like Candid Camera or MTV Bakra? Did I actually have a camera zooming in on me? Am I on TV?!? I absently ran my fingers through my hair. I was feeling extremely self-conscious! I just wanted to get the hell outta the place! (Random notes of enlightenment: My brain goes off into tangents in the opposite direction just when I want it to stay focussed.)  Perhaps Mr. X was too numb with shock to have such crazy ideas floating around in his head. he Biker dude wasn't done with the expletives. He mouthed yet another string of well-chosen obscenities. Even passers-by stopped to gawk at the scene. I really wanted to get outta that place!!  Mr.X had had enough. He spluttered in indignation, pulled himself up to full height and started to approach the Biker dude. Aaah, now this was gonna get interesting! :)  But things took yet another crazy twist as the manic look on the Biker dude's face flickered off. To be replaced by a slight hint of confusion. And then, full-blooded horror!  Mr. X seemed puzzled at the reaction too. Things fell into place when the Biker dude slapped his forehead and exclaimed \"phone-a vei da naaye. unaala en maaname pochu!\".

Dropping whatever does not serve your best interests is a completely liberating experience\u2014it makes you so strong that nothing in this world can shake you.  When you are ready for true liberation, true freedom and personal empowerment, then you are ready for the power of DSN!\n\nLast week I did DSN course for the second time and believe me,it was a life transforming experience. The dynamic,energetic teacher reaching out to every participant,bringing joy and enthusiasm to all was really min blowing....or should i say, JHHHAKKKKAS !!!! Yeah,you guessed it right...the teacher was none other than Anand Rajenderan...he had promised that all the sheep joining the course will go back as lions by the end of three days...and so it happened !!!\n\nThe padmsadhna sessions,meditations,Om namo shivay chantings....it was so blissful....and what we looked forward to the most was knowledge sessions by Anandji.Guruji's teachings were explained in such fun-filled manner and the best part used to be when Anandji used to point out the 'Pappus' from the crowd and they had to stand before the crowd till the time they started participating whole-heartedly.\n\nThe processes were amazing as usual.We had so much fun when guys were dressed like gals and vice-versa.Bhanu and me had so much fun eve-teasing...at the end of the process,all the men vowed that they will never ever tease a woman again :) Criticism process was an eye-opener in so many ways.Every process taught something new and helped in connecting with others as if they were my own.\n\nThe charisma of Anandji was witnessed in full throttle on the last day.Everyone was so over-whelmed by the Guru stories he told.That day i learnt the importance of 'giving'.Donations were raised for constructing a temple of knowldge in our city beautiful.Our dsn group raised almost 20 lakhs.there were tears of gratitude in everyone's eyes.till date we'd been living for ourselves but that day we realised what satisfaction one gets when we do something for the society we live in.\n\nThe course ended with a rocking satsang...we danced nonstop to the beats of the dhol....followed by rocking bhajans...and the award of the best dancer goes to...Anandji again...who set the floor on fire by his energetic dance.he danced with each and every participant and everyone was so excited to geta chance to shake a leg with their jhakkas teacher.\n\nSo, ladies and gentlemen \u2013 if there is a DSN course with Anandji nearby you, it is a must attend course.

Raman Varman tried to cross a check-post that he crossed daily while going to his office. But he was stopped by a security personnel who said, \u201cSir, Indians are not supposed to enter through this way. You may take the next turn instead.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean Indians can\u2019t enter. This is India. And it\u2019s a silly check-post and not an international border !\u201d\n\u201cYou are wrong sir. Do you see that statue there ?\u201d, he said pointing to a far white statue that was crowned and had a torch in its right raised hand.\n\u201cYou are trying to enter America sir. And you know that the law...\u201d\n\u201cWhhhhaaattt...oooo...wow...aaahhaaa...\u201d Raman\u2019s involuntary expressions rose from wonderment to more wonderment before the security-man knocked at the window glass of his car, \u201cYou are obstructing the traffic sir!\u201d\n\nRaman woke up in the midnight. He smiled, switched on the light, took his note book and drew a rough sketch of what he saw in the dream, closed the note book, switched off the light, smiled again, and slept.\n\nRaman was a medical representative (MR) and had quit 3 firms earlier all on the same unique ground that MRs should be respected by the company coz they are most crucial in making a deal with docs n hospitals. Al Toro Pharma was his current place of work.\n\nHe saw weird things in his dreams and painted the same ASAP before the prints of the imagination became too dull to be transferred to the canvas. One day he dreamt the Qatub Minar just adjacent to Taj Mahal. He was happy to bring entirely 2 rules separated by 300 years too close. He had dreamt the water of Ganga going up the hills. He had rented a hall every inch of which was full of deep non-sense that had originated in his mind in the past. The paintings sell for handsome amount, and Raman soon became a known image in the locality, and quite unlike the SENSEX, the radius of his popularity was on an increase.\n\nHe was uni-directionally paranoid the direction being that of his wife from where apart from the routine curses one day came a rotating a screwdriver that just missed Raman\u2019s eyes! Yet he loved her very much coz except few hours in the day she too loved him.\nHis position in Al Toro became odd when he bought a Volkswagen- a machine that only earned envy for Raman. They say that you can\u2019t but fall prey to the arrows of envy. And Raman was no exception. He decided to quit Al Toro, and establish himself as a full-time painter \u2013 a decision not in conformity with his wife\u2019s opinion.\n\nBeing a full time painter of weirdness he would force himself to imagine insanities. He begins to avert truth and the general perception of the things. He would rotate his head and try to see the inverted objects only to confuse his mind as to what the reality is. He would try to imagine ordinary objects (like his Parker pen) as an exotic piece of excellence. He would find flaws in everything he saw, and wish if they could be as per his imagination. Surprises, he began to believe, is the most important thing that can keep you away from this general monotony of life. \u201cSurprises\u201d, he said, \u201cis more powerful than happiness ... it keeps you alive !\u201d. His public behaviour has come (declined) a long way - from humour to unwanted humour to objectionable humour to darkness and pity - a behaviour that created a mix of irritation and sympathy in those who confronted him.\n\nOne day he dreamt God speaking to him. He painted it being careless about the result. \u201cIs God weird ?\u201d, was a question to be answered. \u201cWhat Mr Raman want to say through his popular non-sense is that God is weird !\u201d. What Raman painted was a never-before imagination. This made many sectarians ask, \u201cIs this a Hindu God or Allah or Jesus or Buddha or... \u201d. The point was if it was Allah then it was the sole responsibility of that community to object, and likewise for others.\nThe defence from Raman was, \u201cGod is not weird! It\u2019s his talking to me that is weird. As in many of my paintings, it\u2019s not the absolute objects that are weird, rather it\u2019s their actions are weird...\u201d\nBut the property of the mob is \u2013 it doesn\u2019t listen to arguments if it has once made its mind (if at all that exists anywhere)! The carnival of absurdities (his Hall) was reduced to carnival of ashes (by fundamentalists) as the last amber grew cold. The outcome \u2013 it was proved that God is not weird! He protects himself through these agents who would commit all sins, but not hear anything against something in front of which they rotate incense stick in the morning.\n\nRaman did not go out for many days. He kept imagining and drawing on his note-book and oscillating brushes on the canvasses. His deliberate jumping into imagination became his habit, and soon his very character. It became hard for him to distinguish between a real event and a non-real. He would meet many distant people without going out at all! This was different from schizophrenia where you have a finite number of illusions playing around you. It appeared some strange case of hyper-reality, where the brain could deliberately detach itself from even the most known things.\n\nToday he decided to go out of his house and meet his friends at Al Toro and see the Raman Hall. Luckily he found the door of his house open for the first time since many days. He rushed out. Many men asked him to stop. They chased him. But he managed to escape. \u201cGod ! The world is getting madder day by day !\u201d, he thought.\n\nHe changed his plan, and went to see his hall first. He asked a man nearby, \u201cSir, there used to be a Raman Hall here. Where is that?\u201d. \u201cRaman Hall? There was no such tower here. This had been a community centre since I saw it for the first time in 1981.\u201d He had misunderstood the building he thought. He came out and inquired about the Hall, but all in vain. It getting dark, he returned to his house.\n\nHe entered his house, and surprisingly found that a thick layer of dust had taken the responsibility of protecting everything. He took something from the floor, and removed the dust from some parts. Newspaper. And it showed an edifice. Wait. \u201cI have seen this place...Oh this is where I came out from in the morning. This is my house! \u201d . He removed dust further and saw himself going into the edifice with some policemen. He could not make out. He cleared all dust. The news read \u201cRaman gets relief. Acquitted on ground of strange disorder. Taken to Protege Asylum.\u201d The body of the news was hardly legible. He was tired. He cleaned a part of the sofa and lay there before he found a dust laden portrait, the garland of which were cocooned by spider webs, on the wall. He cleaned the portrait.

After all they have been given by spiritual masters ! But conceptualizations are done merely for the benefit of intellect driven humans trying to fathom truth through their cognitive abilities. My agreeing with them or disagreeing with them does not take me any closer or any farther from truth. As truth stands beyond what I agree with or do not agree with. So, do I have faith? Faith in whom, faith in what? Do I have faith in my Guru? Do I have faith in Him? Do I feel that He is with me? I am protected? Or better still do I feel that I am with Him? Both don't seem to be absolutely true. It is neither. Where is He? Who is He? If He is there then He doesn't seem to be with me and it doesn't seem as though I am with Him. He seems so distant. Yet He is!\nI stand there shorn of His proximity or distance. I am and He is! He is a part of me, an integral part of me, He is me !! Is it blasphemy to say He is me? I don't know. He is me.\nI am also shorn of all protection............ protection from whom, from what.

OMG!! not Kyunki's but Mahabharata's Karan.Ill just give a brief recap courtesy: \"Wikipedia\"\n\nKarna was born to his mother Kunti by his father the solar deity Surya. Karna was born, before his mother's marriage to prince Pandu. When Kunti was young, the sage Durvasa visited her father's palace. She served the sage with utmost care for an entire year. Pleased by her service and hospitality, the sage foresaw her future difficulty after marriage of not having a child through Pandu, and hence granted her a boon to overcome this difficulty. By this boon she could call upon any god of her choice, and beget a child. Out of curiosity, Kunti still being unmarried, decided to test the power of the boon. She invoked the mantra and called Surya. Bounded by the power of the mantra, Surya appeared before her and granted her a son, who was as radiant and robust as Surya himself. This baby was born with an armour ('Kavacha') and a pair of earrings ('Kundala') attached to him. Though Kunti retained her virginity, she was unwilling to face the world as an unwed mother. She placed the baby Karna in a basket and set him afloat on the holy river Ganga in the hope that he would be taken in by another family.\n\n\nNow lets move to my View\n\nImagine people working in IT industry getting such boon or power.Oh life would become so easy or i should say mantr(a)i :) i.e if IT people have mantra called Kunti's Ghanti then it would be so cool...\n\nGuy working in IT industry is so happy to say my office timings are 8 to 5 so I get evenings.Is it true??Yes very much for few months atleast.Then he has to be isolated \"Main aur mera Manager types\".His friends start shouting at him on not coming to any trips,function,get together etc.\nHis gf/wife is like tell me if you are going to come for dinner then only ill think of making something; but think of it is it possible to inform at 6:30 in the evening that ill be home by 8:00??? No its not.Server might crash at 7:45 usually when cab is ready to pick you or at 7:40 your manager might ping you \"Hey did u get time to look into this\"??? If this continues how would people have family life?? Forget about life family atleast ?? :P\nThe other day I saw a kid in my society may be 5-6 year old kid his grandpa like came and took him for a ride I was surprised seeing grandpa taking a kid on a drive n all usually we see kid holding grandpa's hand and going to nana-nani park or a walk,but then I came to know that he was his dad and not grandpa.Result of starting late family or loss of (grey) hair due to work n tension.\n\nLet's see the following story\n\nA 30 year guy get married and tells his wife see we will plan our honeymoon a month later so that I can impress my boss saying seeing the work I have postponed my honeymoon and will get 1 month leave.What a plan??? Cool !\nAfter 3 days of marriage he goes to office and mails his manager for leave for a month.Week passes no reply,then he sends a meeting request to the manager for the same.Before manager could accept the meeting request manager calls this guy for some discussion.He tells seeing your dedication we are offering you onsite opportunity to london for 3 months initially I understand you have just got married but this also leads to your promotion so thought of having a word with you.Poor guy with a smile on his face and tears too goes back to his desk.\nThen he goes home and tells this to his wife;wife under impression that she would also go to london becomes happy (which is not really going to happen).Husband with all guts tells his wife see we can plan our honeymoon soemtime later as this is a good opportunity and I am thinking of taking it .\nNext day wife comes up with this Kunti's Ghanti and tells I have got this Kunti's Ghanti mantra which would help me till the time you are back :) It works the same way it worked for Kunti but this is more advanced with protection :)If i skip the protection part of that mantra there are high chances that I get pregnant; but am thinking of why not take Hrithik Roshan or Brad Pitt's name in this Mantra instead of you.\nListening to this husband faints!\n\nStory 3:\n\nOnce a husband returns home after 3 days of work and hugs his wife and say's I think we should start a family.Wife say's oh u had time to discuss this I already applied Kunti's Ghanti a month back thinking you might not have time to even discuss this..dont worry have taken your name and waiting for the result :)\n\nSaw how Kunti's Ghanti useful for early family planning?? :P", "gender": "M"}, {"text": "Gay rights pros and cons   we all have been listening about gay rights these days. Recently Delhi high court also agreed to make homosexual relationship as a legal act. Prior to this historic and a bit controversial decision homosexual activities were considered as criminal under section 377. But now a man can marry a man and a woman can marry a woman.\nSome people consider it right saying that we should not discriminate people based on their sexual habits. If some one is homosexual that is his or her choice and we should respect it. If we give their relationship a recognition in society then it will decrease the chances of unsafe sex. That will help in reducing the cases of HIV positive. Adding to that homosexual culture has gained a lot of popularity and it is not possible to keep suppressing them.\nAt the same time some people consider it is wrong. They say it is not our culture. It belongs to western countries and it suits them only. Some feel that it violates their religion and they are ready to do anything to stop it from spreading. Some politicians also have jumped into that thinking it may be another hot issue for vote bank. But still i feel that though many people in our country have their opinion about this issue not too many really bother about it. Specially those who are straight. So I just hope it wouldn't entertain politicians much.As far as religious feelings are concerned i will say that all the rules of all the religions were made by human beings only.So we can change them according to the need of hour.\nNow we have seen some people favour homosexuality while some oppose it. I kind a have mix opinion about it. Well if someone is not straight then I don't think he or she should be left out of the society it will only make things worse and yes at the end of the day its their life and they have right to decide which way they gonna live it. Straight or Gay (lesbian). I guess most of the youngster like me will be thinking the same way and they really don't mind homosexuality being legal.\nBut but but.............\nThere is something that can be really bothering. I guess first time I heard about this gay thing from some of my friend i was in 10th or 11th standard and my first reaction was how can it be possible. How can a boy love a boy or how can a girl fall with another girl. I thought he was kidding. Only after some time i figured out he was right. Well for most of us we heard about the homosexuality things a bit too late and by that time it was very difficult to think about loving same sex person. Because most of us never thought that other way round also could have been possible and by the time we came to know we were already fond of other sex. But the way it has gone and grown in India in last few years it is getting a bit dangerous. Still thinking why? well because next generation will be knowing these things from their childhood. We will find the cases of homosexuality increasing and its legalisation will make it even worse. Most of the people who are standing today for gay rights will not find it the same if their kids follow the unconventional sex(homosexuality) habits. Most of the celebrities and young people stood in favour of gays. But they will definitely not support some one of their family following the Idea.Well currently we see in some of the colleges management is very strict with boys and girls hanging around together.But what they gonna do about this whole gay(lesbian) thing?? forget about hanging around they will be in same hostel and may be sharing room as well.I guess parents too will be having nightmares.Stop the kid(boy) from going out with girls or boys. So we have tough time ahead with this gay stuff.Hope it goes fine...............", "gender": "M"}, {"text": " Chile Earthquake and Spiritual Promptings\nOn the LDS Church News website last week there was an article about the earthquake in Chile and how the mission there had already been preparing for an earthquake in the weeks leading up to the quake. The article is an e-mail written by Sister Lisa Laycock, wife of Chile Santiago East Mission President Larry Laycock, and originally sent to her friends and family after the quake. Here is an excerpt:\n\n\n\"When we were set apart for this calling, Elder [Richard G.] Scott of the [Council] of the Twelve Apostles taught us many important lessons. He spoke from personal experience when he was a mission president in Argentina. One message that he shared with us is this: 'At times, during your mission, you will be awakened in the middle of the night or the early morning hours with thoughts of specific things you should do for certain missionaries. Do not ignore these thoughts. They are promptings from the Holy Ghost who will communicate with you in the stillness of the night or the peace of the early morning hours. He will speak to you then because that is when you are still enough to hear.' Elder Scott further instructed us to keep a notebook beside our bed so that we could record these precious promptings. He said that by the next morning, we would be likely to forget the promptings if we didn't write them down.\n\"We have been astonished at the fulfillment of Elder Scott's prophetic words. We have received many promptings in the exact manner that Elder Scott described. We are so thankful that Elder Scott taught us how to recognize and act upon these precious promptings. Had he not taught us, we may not have given these promptings the attention they require.\n\"Nearly two and one half weeks [before the earthquake], I was awakened at around 4 a.m. by just such a prompting. I did not hear a voice, but the thought was as clear as if it had been in the form of spoken words: 'There is going to be an earthquake. Prepare your missionaries.' I sat up in bed and immediately remembered Elder Scott's counsel. That morning I told Larry what had happened. He immediately set to work organizing our missionaries to prepare for an earthquake.\n\"In talking with our office missionaries to arrange for them to put together a list of everything we would need to prepare...in both Spanish and English...we discovered that the Lord had also let two of our office missionaries know of the possibility of an earthquake (in the form of dreams) and the need to prepare our mission. We set a goal and arranged our schedule so that we could visit every apartment in the mission to check for safety and to review with our missionaries what to do in case of an earthquake. What a wonderful experience we have had as we have met with them and shared scriptures with them about being spiritually and physically prepared. '...if ye are prepared, ye shall not fear' (D&C 38:30). We instructed every missionary to have a \"go-bag\" (36 hour kit). We reviewed our emergency action plan with them of where to go and what to do if they had phone service and in case they did not. We gave everyone a paper with all instructions in English and Spanish, and we reminded them that 'this life is the time to prepare to meet God' (Alma 34:32-34). We shared with them our thoughts and feelings about the need for spiritual and physical safety. Some of them became frightened and asked us if we knew something they didn't know. We smiled and repeated '...if ye are prepared, ye shall not fear.' We didn't want to unduly alarm them, but we did want to impress upon them the need to be prepared. We tearfully reminded them of our recent transfer conference where we had shared our feelings about our dear Elder McKay Burrows who was unexpectedly called home in January while serving his mission in Romania...how he was prepared in every way to meet God. We reissued our challenge to 'be prepared' in every way. Then we knelt with them in their apartment and dedicated each apartment, asking for a blessing of safety and security to be upon every apartment.\n\"When the earthquake came, we were prepared. We did not experience the panic that many felt. We knew we were prepared. Because of the words of the Lord's chosen apostle, Elder Scott, we had listened and heeded the quiet, but clear promptings of the Holy Ghost. We were blessed with peace in the midst of chaos. We learned an important lesson: our preparation helped us to avoid panic and fear, but the Lord, in His wisdom, allowed us to experience enough discomfort to know that He has all power. He is in charge. We are nothing without Him. We are dependent upon Him for every breath we take. Only He can save us from death and destruction. He is the way, the truth, and the life. He is our perfect example. If we follow Him, we will be saved through obedience to the laws and ordinances of His Gospel.\n\"As the earthquake became more violent, the mission home groaned and wailed. The power died, so the whole city was black. The windows made a hideous screeching sound, and flying objects banged against swaying walls. The printer/fax machine, books, book ends, and fifty-pound television burst from the entertainment center and crashed to the floor, cabinets emptied, drawers flew open, the refrigerator moved, water sloshed out of the toilets, the floor jolted up and down as we ran across it trying to hold onto the walls to keep from falling down, and the piano toppled over like a small toy. As we made our way to the back yard, I remember thinking, 'God is all-powerful. He is our only refuge from this horrible mess.' I prayed and prayed for Him to still the earth. When we reached the back yard, we watched in terror. By the light of the moon we could see the swimming pool water form giant waves and crash out onto the rocks. House and car alarms screamed into the night...some from being crushed by falling debris and others I guess from the bizarre movement of the earth. I am not sure if the intense rumbling sounds came from the earth itself or from everything else that was shaking so violently. Finally, it stopped. When the calm came, we had to sit down because our legs were weak and unstable. My legs stayed wobbly all day and night yesterday. Today (Feb. 28) the muscles in my legs hurt like I ran a marathon. The aftershocks have been extremely unsettling. Each one begins like the one last night started. We just close our eyes and wait to see if it escalates or dies down. I have never experienced anything like this!\"\nWow! The description of the earthquake was pretty cool to read, I don't think I would ever want to experience that myself. But the description of how the mission was already preparing for the earthquake was even more amazing. Heavenly Father really cares about us and he does provide us with spiritual promptings if we care to listen. What would have happened if this sister and the other missionaries had decided to ignore the prompting they received? I'm sure all the missionaries and their families are grateful that the three individuals who received promptings to prepare for an earthquake were in tune enough with the Holy Ghost to realize that it was a warning and take action.", "gender": "F"}, {"text": "Is uncle \"SAM\"behind \"TERRORISM\"????  -  It is my debut in blogs and i was thinking to do it long time ago but cannot.Now I have started it ,then I thought on what thing should I start.

It wouldn\u2019t be wrong if you say I was workaholic in last 7 months. So I decided to take 8 to 10 days break. And I decided to go for pune as I have always liked this place. So let\u2019s see what happened there.\nI got ticket for a direct train from trichy to pune and I decided to board in that train in spite of the fact that I would reach there sharp 2 a.m. because that was the only train that has seats available. When it reached some place called Sholapur in Karnataka or Maharashtra people started closing and bolting the doors and windows. I asked what the matter was. Someone told me that some people may come to rob the train with swords and guns. He also told that last time he traveled through this train and robbers came and robbed the train. (What the hell. That is why I got the tickets for this train. There were 4 or 5 constables also in the train with guns to protect us). But I think it was my luck so nothing happened. I spent most of my journey reading my novel or watching out of the window. (No hot chicks to check out :().\nI was praying my train to be late as I was going to my sister\u2019s home in pune and she and my jiju were to come after 12 in the noon. But they left keys for me with their neighbors. But I couldn\u2019t have gone someone\u2019s home at 3 a.m. in the morning to ask for the key. My train reached on time. So I thought I should rather wait on station. There is one nice restaurant on station (I don\u2019t remember the name as usual). It is 24*7 restaurant and its kind a place where you would love to go and have something. I have never seen such restaurant on any other station. I went there to have something and pass my time. Suddenly when I was on counter I got a call from my friend. He is studying in Lonavala. Dude 2 a.m. in the morning and he is calling he must be here somewhere I thought. I picked and he was seating behind me. We had a long chat, some food and coffee. I was meeting him after 3.5 years. I guess the World is really small. He had his train at 4:30. So we chatted for 2.5 hrs. I left at 6 a.m. and reached home around 7 after struggling with auto walas.\nOne day I spent sleeping and rest 3 were spend in seeing the beauty of pune. Now you must be wondering what is so beautiful in pune. Yup there are no tourist spots like in some other places. But city is full of youths and things that attract youths :). I played a lot with piyush (my nephew). Last time I saw him he was not even 1 year old. This summer he will turn 3. Kids and food are hard to resist. My taste buds were happy after long time. So I played a lot with him and also ate a lot. We sindhi are known for our passion for food and clothes. I haven\u2019t seen anyone else spending as much money on food and clothes as we do. And our food can\u2019t be finished without dessert. So I was loaded with a lot of stuff. I also went to my cousin. He is currently working in CRL (part of tata group)in pune. That is a lab where World\u2019s 4th and Asia\u2019s no. 1 supercomputer is kept. He told me a lot about his work and supercomputer. Though I couldn\u2019t go to his lab as visitors were allowed on Saturdays only and I was heading for kalyan(1 hr form Bombay) before that. We went for movie (avatar) one evening. We thought as it is a week day we will get tickets. But we couldn\u2019t get for evening as well as night show. We went for next day morning show (8:30 a.m.). Well pune girls were quite fashionable and I didn\u2019t miss any opportunity to check them out. 2 years back when I went to pune their shorts used to be below knees but in these 2 years they have come above knees. I don\u2019t know where they will be in next few years (lol :D :) ). Pune was chilly in morning and nights. But still when we went for the morning 8:30 show girls came wearing shorts and sleeveless. I realized that its quite tough to be a girl in a city like pune :D. These girls were no less than fire in a chilly morning. Anyways we went for the movie. I read a review of the movie somewhere before watching it and it said \u201cyou have never seen anything like this before\u201d and yup these words were quite true. I saw it in 3D and found it to be really awesome.\nAfter spending 4 or 5 days I left for kalyan and spent couple of days there. I booked the window seat in the train so i could enjoy the beauty of Lonavala and Khandala. Both the places are beautiful but if you want to see its true colors you should go in rainy season. I also had plan for Bombay but couldn\u2019t go. In kalyan again most of my time went in talking to my cousin and wandering in shops and streets. I and my cousin discussed a lot about our college lives and all the funny stuff. Couple of years ago we two were youngest in our family until some offspring came and snatched our title :(. Anyways we are still the rock star of our family I guess :). So we had good time.\nAll good things come to an end. So was this trip. :(. But I had good time there and put on some wait too. :(.

DELIVERY \nWireframes, flow diagrams, personas, card sorts, content strategy documents, etc. All of these things are important to design, and designers need some combination of them to synthesize their user research and communicate what they\u2019re doing with the other members of the team.\n\nBut too often these deliverables are the last line of contact for designers. Too often these deliverables are what designers prepare and then hand off to implementors. Then they shuffle off to create more deliverables and the cycle is repeated.\n\nIn the end deliverables are merely artifacts of the design process. They are not the final design, they are not the artifact of experience. The end user never interacts with them\u2026they interact with the product or service that is actually delivered.\n\nThat\u2019s the difference: deliverables are divorced from delivery.\n\nThus, the task of a UX designer, in order to stay true to our calling, doesn\u2019t stop at any deliverable. Even if our \u201cjob\u201d is to create wireframes, we cannot be satisfied with passing off wireframes to other team members. If we are truly concerned with the experience of the people who use our product/service, we will infiltrate their world\u2026we will demand to know the quality of their experience.\n\nMany UX designers are judged on the quality of their deliverables. This is necessary to a point, we must make sure each step is faithfully executed. But to truly be a user experience designer, we must have a longer scope. We can\u2019t stop at deliverables. We must extend through delivery.\n\nDeliverables are diminishing in importance. Sketches, super important to early design synthesis, have fleeting value. They are valuable for a very short period of time. Design, implement, iterate, move on. Record the learning, but don\u2019t judge the sketch, judge the resulting experience.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re not involved in the day to day feedback loop of your user\u2019s experience, make sure you get involved. Ask about your feedback channels: support emails, call-center requests, twitter mentions, all of it. Do regular surveys and user testing. Investigate. Demand data. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re just creating deliverables and missing the forest for the trees.\n\nExperience, in the end, cannot be captured in a deliverable.", "gender": "M"}, {"text": "My youngest brother does not have much of a memory for directions and maps. While this leads to some friendly jibes about his lack of that so-called \"manly\" trait of the compass in the head, so to speak, it led to me to think about this whole notion of \"necessary skills\". So when I can look up directions on Google maps from my mobile phone, or have an in-car GPS system give me directions turn by turn and even notify me of traffic conditions, is a sense of physical direction an important skill any more?  I look back and realize that technology trends tend to define what skills are \"in\" or \"out\". I have forgotten the art of memorizing phone numbers, because we know share contacts through bluetooth, text messages and missed calls. Come to think of it, I have also lost the unique Indian skill of being able to buy a black ticket at a crowded cinema when the box office tells you that the tickets are sold out. That's because I buy my tickets and choose my seats online now. A few years back, I was part of a technical interview panel for my company, grilling some poor people on the basics of C++ and Java.

I watched so many hours, in fact, that I had a dream last night that I was Mary, Noah (of the Arc), and Jesus rolled into one. \n\nFor Xmas eve I went over to my friend Ridge's house in Queens. We watched Peanuts cartoons, Edward Scissorhands, and ate Jumbalya or whatever it's called/spelled. Afterwards I headed back into the city a little earlier than planned and had a quick drink with Marc. I also tried to climb into his suitcase so he could take me to Australia with him for when he goes to interview the Vines. As I was heading back home, my brother Lawrence called me just as I was driving past him on the street in my cab.

Apparently the Lubuvatch Organization were in their Mitzvah Mobile outside of Crobar trying to recruit new followers of the ultra-orthodox jewish cult-like group. When I was little my mom used to take me to visit Rabbi Schneerson (sp?) who is the person the Lubuvatch's look up to as a sort of profit. We'd wait in a long line in Brooklyn for hours and hours and walk up to him, hand him a dollar, he'd give us a blessed dollar in return, mumble something or another, and then we'd go off on our way. I was about 8 years old when we did this, so my memory is a bit cloudy... however, I'm sure he brought happiness to a lot of people. I'm just confused by what the Lubuvatch community is trying to do with their Mitzvah Mobiles... i should do some research. \n\nSpeaking of Lawrence, he changed his friendster photo to images from high school. He was so fucking cute and new wave. Look!. \n\nYesterday, for Xmas Day, Nate the fabulous Roommate, cooked an amazing meal for his bandmates. It looked amazing... I couldn't eat it cause it wasn't kosher, but basically it was chicken rolled with ricotta and feta cheese, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. Nate cooks! He's like the best boy in the whole world. He also got a Christmas tree for the apartment which he decorated with white lights and blue balls (to pay respect to Hannukah), and we made an angle for the top using an image of Thom Yorke i found in Blender magazine. \n\nAfter dinner I went to the movies with Karen and Jordan to see \"Big Fish\" (I was crying like a pms-ing girl who has just watched a Sally Struthers \"kids in africa need your money\" commercial at the end... not to mention squealing everytime Ewan came on screen). We all noticed Drew and Fab in line for popcorn behind us and so this prompted Jordan to ask quite loudly while we were sitting down \"I THOUGHT DREW AND FAB WERE OVER?\" not noticing them sitting two rows directly in front of us. God Bless Jordan for delivering the quote of the night. So Drew and Fab are back on! \n\n \nWhen I got home, after going to Lit, I watched the World Idol competition that i had taped while at the movies.

Not Gilligan\u2019s Island reruns.\n\nI recognize that with openness comes the risk of the least common denominator dominating.  Porn has just as much right to dominate the net as any other app. But should it ?\n\nYes it should. The lesson of TV over the internet vs TV over digital cable or satellite isnt about openness. Its about the value of Application Specific Networks. DIgital CAble is an application specific network. Its only job is to serve up content and it works very well.\n\nThe FCC needs to recognize this and start working with internet broadband providers to define tunnels,  Private Virtual Networks  or just plain reserved bandwidth that are saved for future applications. When a transformative application presents itself, there should be an opportunity to define the network to optimize that application.", "gender": "M"}, {"text": "Forgiven not Forgotten 1\nThe meeting of the Indian Council of Textile Owners had just dispersed. The lounge of the hotel \u2018Grandeur\u2019 was filled with rich businessmen, old and young alike; the young entrepreneurs were being introduced to the elder members by the Chairman, Mr. Ashok Sahai.\nAt the centre of the lounge stood Mr.Ryan, Ryan Jindal, surrounded by a group, consisting of the richest members of the council. He needed no introduction. The Jindal Textile Corporation had been the most powerful and successful industry in India for the past 15 years and had only doubled in its value ever since Mr.Ryan inherited it after his father five years back. Ryan had been an MBA fresher when he took up the responsibility; everybody knew there was something else in the man that made him what he was- the king of the Jindal empire. He had the strong and slender build of an athlete and was dressed in a black suit tailored to perfection. His body looked chiselled, with not a single vestigial muscle. His face was angular with a sharp, pointed nose.he had black curls that fell over his broad forehead. And his eyes\u2026 people who conversed with him rarely looked at his eyes, they made one uncomfortable. They played a huge contrast to the sophistication and aristocracy his clothes displayed. On the surface, they were insolent and impersonal, but anyone with a little more insight could see that they were only a screen to something more savage and terrifying, like the fores of nature bottled up in human form. \nAt present, he was completely bored of the flattery he was being entitled to by a group of businessmen around him. They were saying something about him being the responsible son and the future badshah of the textile world. He smiled and nodded appropriately to all the comments, but his eyes were shifting, scrutinising the groups of people around the room. Suddenly they fixed onto someone, someone standing with Mr. Ashok, being introduced to some others. His eyes never lost sight of her for a moment. He stared at her as she stood there- tall, slender- a picture of elegance. Her face wore a smile- a smile that reflected beauty and self- confidence, but more than everything, they deepened her eyes and the colour on her cheeks. A simple sari of blue silk adorned her, but she looked like she would hardly have looked less elegant in a pair of jeans or trousers.\nFor a few moments, Ryan looked at her and then turned back to the conversation immediately around.\nAfter a quarter of an hour, he heard Mr.Ashok\u2019s voice, \u201cMr.Ryan, may I introduce to you Miss.Tamanna, and Ms...\u201d. \u201cMr.Ryan, Ryan Jindal, I know him quite well, Mr.Ashok.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my pleasure, Ms.Tamanna.\u201d Ryan stretched out his hand, his eyes looking straight at her as if he were challenging her. She met his eyes with defiance and took his hands coolly. Even as their fingers touched, his palm enclosed hers. The warmth from him seemed to spread all through her. Her eyes wavered just an instant and she was the first one to withdraw her hands. \nFor a moment there was troubled silence, and then Tamanna composed herself and managed a weak smile, \u201cNice to meet you Mr.Ryan\u201d.\n\u201cOf course, Ms.Tamanna, looking forward to see more of you.\u201d\nIn sometime, Ryan took leave. He never stayed back for the Council dinners. As he walked back towards his car, he thought of her again. There was something about her, in her poise, but she had wavered from that at his touch. The thought made him happy, though no girl had ever resisted his touch. But he knew this had been different. She had been genuinely surprised, perhaps troubled, at her own response. He would find out more soon.\nThinking so, he directed his remote at his car. Something was wrong, it refused to open. He pressed again, no response. \u201cIs anything the matter, Mr.Ryan? That\u2019s my car.\u201d Tamanna stood loking at him, hands folded, a smug smile on her face. Now it was his turn to be genuinely surprised. \u201cThis is your car?\u201d He had every reason to be surprised. The car was the first of its kind in India and he had been the first Indian to get it. He loved cars, especially, huge, black ones. He would never have imagined anyone elseat the Council to have ever owned one like that. She broke into his reverie, \u201cIf you\u2019ll please excuse me,\u201d and she pressed the button on her remote. The car dutifully opened its door for the rightful owner. As she walked past him to get into the car, he involuntarily shifted aside, and saw his car parked some 100m away. \u201cGood night, Mr. Ryan\u201d, she said and just sped off.\nFor one moment he stood dumbfound and then a smile crossed his lips, a cold, cruel smile. He had discovered what was different about her. After a long time, he had been challenged. He felt a gush of adrenaline. She was an independent will, a tigress. He would possess her, he decided, \u201cVery soon\u2026\u201d, were the only words that came out of his mouth.", "gender": "F"}, {"text": "The convention overall went really well. Every year it just seems to get bigger. I've been to a lot of gaming conventions in the Houston area and Owlcon remains the one to go to. A lot of those conventions come and go, but Owlcon has always remained rock steady. I can't wait until next year. This year was a bit special to top it off. Since I won the logo contest, I got to see my design on hundreds of gamers!! I can't really say I was wild about the purple but hey, it was my design on hundreds of gamers!! It was a very cool feeling. To make it all the more better, GURPS game I ran went really well and I even got to catch up with an old Army buddy I used to work and game with. Back when I still wore Army greens to work instead of pajamas, Matt and I used to hobble along company PT runs together at Fort Campbell. We went to AIT together and somehow managed to get the same duty station together for our first (and last) assignment. Both of us not being strong runners on our PT tests, we ended up doing mandatory PT.", "gender": "M"}, {"text": "Music - The fact that we have something called music to appreciate is utterly amazing\u2026I consider it one of the ingenious things we discovered(mind you..not invented).The right music just lightens up your day! It still amazes me as to how we react emotionally to different frequency of sounds\u2026how do we do that ? hmmm..I am no scientist so won\u2019t delve any deeper :)  I know that the genre of music is a touchy subject for some\u2026for example: i am not a fan (at all) of heavy metal\u2026I detest it..but doesn\u2019t mean i wont allow anyone else to decide for themselves.  Personally i have no particular genre to call \u2018my kind of music\u2019,it all depends on my mood\u2026when i am up for it..I enjoy mostly romantic and soulful music..but i also enjoy R&B,Bollywood and Pop a lot too..Of late..soft rock and punk rock have caught my eye(Green day :) )  Anyway that\u2019s a lot about me\u2026just one question\u2026how many of you out there listen to a particular song a million times till you are fed up? (that is my exact story..yeah i am quite boring! :p)  Coming to favorites I have way too many\u2026so many that they can\u2019t even be called favorites anymore.. :) Music can REALLY heal..it\u2019s just a matter of listening to the right songs  so go pick up your i-pod,phone,laptop(or any other instrument that plays music) and get happy!", "gender": "F"}]
